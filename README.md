  This project is a recreated version of an existing one on my profile, as the original was developed as part of the PDSI (Computer Systems Programming) course at the Polytechnic Institute of Viana do Castelo, in the ESTG (School of Technology and Management).
  The project consists of a website where anyone can report a problem they experienced and receive help from people who have gone through similar situations or from specialists, if they prefer. The application is able to identify whether a person is a technology specialist or not and distinguishes between different user types. There are three types of users: "Specialists", "Regular Users", and "Admin".
